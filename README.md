This repository contains the materials for D-Lab Python Geospatial Fundamental workshop. 

### Prerequisites

We recommend attending [Python Fundamentals](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/python-fundamentals-parts-1-3/2024-01-08)
and [Python Data Wrangling](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/python-data-wrangling-and-manipulation-pandas/2023-08-17) prior to this workshop.

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Recognize different forms of geospatial data and coordinate reference system (CRS).
- Use `GeoPandas` and `matplotlib` libraries to map and analyze spatial data.
- Apply more advanced Python libraries for interactive visualization.
- Choose domain-specific spatial datasets to create your own maps. 


## Installation Instructions

Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks very easily. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.
2. Download these workshop materials:
    * Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
    * Click "Download Zip".
    * Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).
3. Optional: if you’re familiar with git, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering [GitCloneCommand].

## Is Python not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have Python installed and the materials loaded on your
workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley
Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by
clicking the following button:

[![DataHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FPython-Geospatial-Fundamentals-Pilot&urlpath=tree%2FPython-Geospatial-Fundamentals%2F&branch=main)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and
allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers.
No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser
and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come
back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go
straight to the [D-Lab DataHub](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and
you click on the `Python-Geospatial-Fundamentals-Pilot` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/Python-Geospatial-Fundamentals/HEAD)

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.


## Run the Code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

Provide instructions on running the code, including how to load relevant software (RStudio, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.) and which file to open up. See other repositories for examples.

Additionally, provide instructions on how to run code once it’s open (running Jupyter cells, RMarkdown cells, etc.).
